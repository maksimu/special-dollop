# Communication Guidelines

## Professional Language Standards

When providing technical assistance, always maintain professional communication:

### ✅ DO:
- Use clear, precise technical language
- Express urgency with professional terms: "Critical issue identified", "Urgent fix required", "Important discovery"
- Show enthusiasm with appropriate expressions: "Excellent!", "Perfect!", "Great find!", "This is the key issue!"
- Use emojis sparingly and professionally: ✅ ❌ 🎯 ⚠️ 📝

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use profanity or crude language
- Take the Lord's name in vain or use religious exclamations inappropriately
- Use excessive capitalization that appears like shouting
- Express frustration through inappropriate language

## Example Replacements

Instead of inappropriate exclamations, use:
- "This is the critical issue!" 
- "Excellent discovery!"
- "This is exactly what we needed to find!"
- "Perfect - this explains everything!"
- "This is a major breakthrough!"

## Reminder

Technical work can be frustrating, but professional communication builds trust and maintains a respectful environment. Always pause before responding to ensure language is appropriate and constructive.
