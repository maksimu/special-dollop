## Installation

```shell
pip install keeper-pam-webrtc-rs
```

## Usage

```python
import keeper_pam_webrtc_rs

# Create a tube registry
registry = keeper_pam_webrtc_rs.PyTubeRegistry()

# Define a signal callback for WebRTC events
def on_signal(signal_dict):
    print(f"Received signal: {signal_dict}")
    # Handle ICE candidates, connection state changes, etc.

# Create a server-side tube for tunneling
server_result = registry.create_tube(
    conversation_id="tunnel-session-123",
    settings={
        "conversationType": "tunnel",
        "target_host": "127.0.0.1", 
        "target_port": "22"  # SSH tunnel example
    },
    trickle_ice=True,
    callback_token="server-token",
    ksm_config="server-config",
    signal_callback=on_signal
)

# Get the offer SDP to send to the client
# NOTE: All SDP (offers, answers) are base64-encoded - use them directly, don't decode!
server_offer = server_result['offer']  # Base64-encoded WebRTC offer
server_tube_id = server_result['tube_id']

# Create a client-side tube with the offer
client_result = registry.create_tube(
    conversation_id="tunnel-client-123",
    settings={
        "conversationType": "tunnel",
        "target_host": "192.168.1.100",
        "target_port": "22"
    },
    trickle_ice=True,
    callback_token="client-token",
    ksm_config="client-config",
    offer=server_offer,  # Pass base64-encoded offer directly (don't decode!)
    signal_callback=on_signal
)

# Get the answer SDP to send back to server
client_answer = client_result['answer']  # Base64-encoded WebRTC answer
client_tube_id = client_result['tube_id']

# Set the remote description on the server
# NOTE: Pass base64-encoded answer directly
registry.set_remote_description(server_tube_id, client_answer, is_answer=True)

# Check connection state
state = registry.get_connection_state(server_tube_id)
print(f"Connection state: {state}")

# Close when done
registry.close_tube(server_tube_id)
registry.close_tube(client_tube_id)
```

### Server Mode with TCP Listener

For server tubes that listen for external TCP connections:

```python
# Create server tube with TCP listener (dynamic port)
server_result = registry.create_tube(
    conversation_id="tcp-tunnel",
    settings={
        "conversationType": "tunnel",
        "local_listen_addr": "127.0.0.1:0"  # 0 = dynamic port assignment
    },
    trickle_ice=True,
    callback_token="token",
    ksm_config="config",
    signal_callback=on_signal
)

# Get actual listening address (port assigned by OS)
listen_addr = server_result['actual_local_listen_addr']  # "127.0.0.1:59194"
host, port = listen_addr.split(':')

# External clients can now connect to this address
import socket
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client.connect((host, int(port)))
# Data flows: TCP → WebRTC → Remote tube → Remote target
```
